Machine Learning (ML) is a field in math and computer science that deals with creating high level abstract models to describe large and complex datasets. As a branch of Artificial Intelligence (AI), ML has existed as a discipline since at least the 1980's, when many of its fundamental concepts and alogirthms were initially theorized and published. In these early days, however, ML was primarily a conceptual field, limited in application by the relatively low computing power of the time. It is only in the last few years, with radical advances in computational and storage capacity, that these ideas have started to be applied at a suitable scale to be able to see their potential.
