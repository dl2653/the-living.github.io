This site uses [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to create static web pages from simple [markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) files. This way of managing content has many advantages over traditional content management systems such as [Wordpress]() or [Drupal]() including:

1. ability to edit content offline using simple text editors
2. no need for databases or dynamic content
3. faster page loads

Even better, Jekyll is [integrated](https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-as-a-static-site-generator-with-github-pages/) with [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/). This allows content pushed to a special repositiory to be automatically converted to static pages, and hosted for free directly from the associated github.io address. This method of blogging has become popular with software developers because it integrates directly within their existing version control workflow. Instead of going through a separate online interface to generate content, blog posts can be mainted offline as simple markdown-formatted text files, and pushed to the web using the Github interface.
